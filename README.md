# NOTE: This application was a coding exercise that was given to me as part of a hiring process. Admittedly, the code isn't at a professional level, and I didn't get the job. I have a full-time job and a lot going on at home lately so I didn't have as much time as I wanted to devote to the coding exercise. I will be slowly polishing it as I have time, and maybe I can use it as an example of my work so I can get another job.

Please see the master branch for the latest code. The original version was quickly put together and didn't use git. I have since remedied that.
